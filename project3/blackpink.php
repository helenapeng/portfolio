The group debuted in August 2016 with their single album Square One, which featured "Whistle" and "Boombayah", their first number-one entries on South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart and the US Billboard World Digital Song Sales chart, respectively. </p>

        <p>Blackpink is the most successful Korean girl group internationally and have often been dubbed the "biggest girl group in the world."[1] They are the highest-charting female Korean act on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 13 with "Ice Cream" (2020), and on the Billboard 200, peaking at number two with The Album (2020), which also set the record for the best-selling album by a Korean girl group and was the first to sell more than one million copies.[2] They were the first girl group to top Billboard's Artist 100 and the first Korean girl group to enter and top Billboard's Emerging Artists chart.[3] Blackpink was also the first female Korean act to receive a certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) with their single "Ddu-Du Ddu-Du" (2018), whose music video was the first by a Korean group to surpass one billion views and is currently the most-viewed by a Korean group on YouTube.[4] Their 2018 song "Kiss and Make Up", a collaboration with Dua Lipa, was the first by a Korean group to receive a certification from the British Phonographic Industry (BPI)[5] and a platinum certification from the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA).[6] In 2022, Blackpink became the first Korean group to top the ARIA Singles Chart with their single "Pink Venom".[7]</p>
            
        <p> Blackpink has broken numerous online records throughout their career.

            <h3>2010-2016: Formation and pre-debut activities</h3>
            <p>Blackpink began forming when YG Entertainment held tryouts worldwide for preteen or teenage recruits to create a new girl group after launching its first major one, 2NE1, in 2009. According to the members, joining the label as trainees was akin to enrolling in a full-time pop-star academy, with Jennie describing the experience as "more strict than school" and Rosé comparing it to The X Factor with dorm rooms. For members who had left their lives outside of South Korea, the pace of training alongside the culture shock was especially difficult.[16] Preparations for Blackpink's debut began as early as 2011, when YG Entertainment revealed on November 14 that their new girl group would debut in the early half of 2012 and feature at least seven members.[17] Since then, numerous news and rumors surfaced surrounding the new girl group's debut being delayed, although there had been no official information.[18][19] It was only on May 18, 2016 that YG Entertainment confirmed the girl group would debut that July, stating that the members were selected through years of stiff competition.[20] The label later confirmed that Jang Hanna and Moon Sua, who were introduced to the public as potential members of the new girl group, were not included in the lineup.[21][22]</p>

            <p>Jennie was the first group member revealed, on June 1, 2016.[23] She joined YG Entertainment as a trainee in 2010 after moving back to South Korea from New Zealand.[24] She had been introduced to the public for the first time in 2012 in a photo titled "Who's that girl?" on YG Entertainment's website on April 10.[25] Jennie continued to be promoted as a member of the new girl group through multiple collaborations: she starred in G-Dragon's 2012 music video for "That XX" from his One of a Kind EP and featured in the song "Black" from his 2013 album Coup d'etat (2013) and Lee Hi's song "Special" from her album First Love (2013).[26][27][28]</p>

            <p>Lisa was revealed as the new girl group's second member on June 8, 2016.[29] She was the only individual among 4,000 applicants to pass the 2010 YG Entertainment audition in her native country Thailand and became the label's first foreign trainee in 2011.[24] She was first introduced in May 2012 in a video that was posted on YG Entertainment's YouTube channel, titled "WHO'S THAT GIRL???".[29] Lisa also appeared in the music video for Taeyang's "Ringa Linga" in 2013. She became a spokesperson for street-wear brand Nona9on in 2015 and cosmetics brand Moonshot in 2016.[30]</p>

            <p>Jisoo was revealed as the new group's third member on June 15, 2016. She joined YG Entertainment as a trainee in July 2011 and appeared in several advertisements and music videos in her pre-debut years, including "Spoiler + Happy Ending" (2014) from Epik High's studio album Shoebox and Hi Suhyun's music video "I'm Different" (2014). She also made a cameo appearance in 2015 drama The Producers.[31]</p>

            <p>Rosé was the final member to be revealed, on June 22, 2016. She ranked first among 700 applicants in the 2012 YG Entertainment audition in Australia, after which she signed a trainee contract with the label and moved to Seoul to begin training.[24] She featured in G-Dragon's track "Without You" (2012) from One of a Kind, credited as "? from YG New Girl Group" until her official public introduction.[32]</p>

            <p>On June 29, YG Entertainment confirmed that the new girl group would have four members instead of the originally planned nine and revealed its official name as Blackpink.[33] According to a label representative, the group's name meant "pretty isn't everything" and symbolized that "they are a team that encompasses not only beauty, but also great talent."[34] Jisoo later disclosed in a press conference that other group names under consideration included Pink Punk, Baby Monster, and Magnum.[35] Blackpink released their first dance practice video on July 6, which garnered much public attention.[36] On July 29, YG Entertainment confirmed that Blackpink's debut would be on August 8, 2016.[37]<p>

            <h3>2016-2017: Debut, rising popularity, and commercial success</h3>

It was described as a "mixed genre of music" and a change of sound from their previous releases.[57] The song peaked at number three on the Gaon Digital Chart and at number 13 on Billboard's Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart, which gave them the highest-charting Korean song by a group in America at the time and made Blackpink the highest-charting Korean group since Wonder Girls in 2009.[58][59] It also debuted at number one on Billboard's World Digital Song Sales chart one day after release, making it their third number-one on the chart.[60] The music video for the song later went on to break the record for the most-liked music video by a Korean girl group on YouTube, as well as the most-viewed K-pop group music video in the first 24 hours of release.[61][62] On July 20, 2017, Blackpink held a showcase at Nippon Budokan in Tokyo, which was attended by over 14,000 people, with as many as 200,000 people attempting to purchase tickets.[63][64] The group made their Japanese debut on August 30, 2017, with the release of a self-titled Japanese extended play that included Japanese versions of their previous singles.[65][66] The EP debuted and peaked atop the Oricon Albums Chart.[67] Blackpink ranked among YouTube's Global Top 25 Songs of the Summer for 2017 with "As If It's Your Last".[68]</p>

            <p>Blackpink's concept is represented by their group name; the "black" side represents their more mature, "girl crush" image, while the "pink" side represents their more cute and colorful image.[160] In an interview with Jimmy Kimmel, Rosé explained that the group feels that "there's two colors that represented us the most 'cause we're very girly but at the same time we're very savage too," naming their song "Pretty Savage" as the song that described them best because "it kind of goes with 'black pink.'"[161] The group's lyrics generally address themes of independence, female empowerment, breakups, and toxic relationships, as well as summer romances.[162][163]</p>
            
            <p>Since their debut, Blackpink have emerged as a prominent act in K-pop and have been labeled the "biggest girl group in the world",[164][165][166] "biggest K-pop girl band on the planet",[167] and "K-pop Queens".[16] Insider wrote that they "[burst] onto the K-pop scene with a set of singles that set them on a path to becoming the ambassadors of the 'girl crush' concept", encapsulating "confidence, sexiness, and inspirational assurance, in the K-pop landscape."[168] Billboard called them "K-pop's most visible representatives" of girl crush following their 2018 release "Ddu-Du Ddu-Du".[169] In South Korea, they ranked first on Forbes Korea Power Celebrity 40 list in 2019, third in 2020, and second in 2021.[170] International media outlets such as Forbes, Billboard and The Hollywood Reporter have recognized the group's popularity and contribution toward spreading the Korean Wave globally.[16][171][172][173] Blackpink were cited by Rolling Stone as an exception to the stereotype that most successful K-pop acts in the United States are boy groups.[174]</p>
            
            <p>The group was also credited as one of the two acts leading Korean music industry growth by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI).[175] Blackpink have appeared in multiple power listings. They were the first girl group to make Forbes' 30 Under 30 Asia[171][176] and were named to the 2019 Time 100 Next list of rising stars, credited with "heralding a new era of Korean acts stepping past language barriers to play global stages" when they became the first K-pop group to perform at Coachella, the world's largest music festival.[177][178][179] In another first for a Korean act, Blackpink were named the biggest musicians in the world in the month of October 2020 in Bloomberg's Pop Star Power Ranking.[180] People magazine included Blackpink on their list of women changing the music industry.[181] They became the third girl group in history to cover Rolling Stone, after the Spice Girls and Destiny's Child, when they covered the magazine's June 2022 issue.[182]</p>
            
            <p>Especially in South Korea, Blackpink's influence also extends to fashion.[193] Each member has served as global ambassadors for different luxury brands: Jisoo for Dior,[194] Jennie for Chanel,[195] Rosé for Yves Saint Laurent,[196] and Lisa for Bulgari and Celine.[197][198] Additionally, Blackpink have been credited for drawing international attention to South Korean hanbok through their modern re-interpretations of the traditional costume in their "How You Like That" music video and performances.[199][200] The group considers fashion to be an important part of their public image, with Jennie telling Elle magazine that it "definitely empowers us as much as music does" and Rosé describing it as inseparable from their music.[164] Their style has been noted for blending group uniformity with individual tastes.[201]</p>
